This is different to Link active build with POB.&#10;- - &quot;Link&quot; will simply link the PoL build with a PoB pastebin, that you can view in Poebuddy&#10;or keep a reference too.&#10;- - With this new feature, you can import your PoB pastebin, and the app will automatically&#10;create a snapshot of the PoB build. All socket groups will be created, and all gems will&#10;get assigned. You can then edit the build normally to add transitions and replacements, or make&#10;your own additions/removals, as always.  After saving the build it can be used as all others and&#10;exported to Pastebin and shared.&#10;- - If you are a build creator, and you want to use this tool, I recommend setting up your POB build&#10; with endgame gems, then import it to POL tweak it and provide both links. The POL link will include the &#10; POB pastebin. This way you can save yourself some time from recreating the gems in POB/POL.&#10;- Added the option to pull all your characters using the POE Api . When starting POL now,&#10; you can choose to set your PoE account and choose your character from the PoE servers.&#10;- - (Your account info must be set to public in order for this to work properly)&#10;- - You can set your account name in the Settings if you don't want to type it in again.&#10;- Designed new UI, and changed the color scheme to Dark. (Colors are simillar to Discord)&#10;- - The old UI , and colors have been trashed, but if you want the option to go White again (weirdo)&#10; let me know and I might include it as a skin.&#10;- Designed new Overlay for the Gem pop-ups. The default is on, and you can change to the old one&#10; from beta UI toggle in settings menu.&#10;- Added gem tags to all Skill gems. You can now search in a new improved UI by filtering tags.&#10;- Added validation functionality.&#10;- -  Now when you have a build that has some kind of error, you can choose to ignore it&#10; by making the build non validated. This will add a Non-valid tag to your build banner on the right &#10;column, where your builds are listed. Then you can go back to the launcher without having to resolve the issue&#10; but you will not be able to select this build as your leveling guide.&#10;- - This introduced a bug, try to avoid making wonky builds :)&#10;- Added a confirmation dialogue when exiting the editor window.&#10;- - If you cancel any changes you made will not be saved.&#10;- Added crafting recipes. You can enable/disable them in the settings menu.&#10;- - Upon entering an area you get an icon (simillar to trial,passive) that indicates zone contains a recipe to find.&#10;- - Assign a keybind to Mark Recipe. Pressing the button will mark the recipe as found&#10; and later you can revisit in a seperate window and check which recipes you missed during leveling.&#10;- Added a keybind lock hotkey. You are not getting any visuals but it should be at least handy.&#10;- - Locking -&gt; any keybinds except the lock keybind, will not trigger any events . &#10;- - Locking -&gt; your overlays will stay in place and cant be dragged.&#10;- - This will allow you to type in chat without the JNA going nuts.&#10;&#10; __Reddit requests__&#10;- You can now access the Settings panel, via the Icon tray icon while in &quot;overlay&quot; mode. &#10;- - (overlay-&gt;when you have set the build and pressed start and the overlays appear)&#10;- Your overlay positions will now persist between app restarts.&#10;- When you create a new gem group it should automatically bring up the attached window.&#10;- Auto-select the first non-support gem entered for each group as the default main gem, user can change later.&#10;&#10; __Bug fixes__&#10;- Fixed a bug with images in Dried Lake and Aqueduct in Act 4. &#10;- Fixed a typo in ascendancy names.&#10;- Fixed the version, and version changelog. Now they are pulled from the server.&#10;- Fixed numerous bugs related to build creation and management&#10;- Stability improvements (hopefully)&#10; &#10; __Changes__&#10;- Gem selection panel has been improved by &quot;Protuhj&quot;. You can now search for gems with an auto-completion box and&#10;auto scrolling when choosing the gem. (possible improvements in the future)&#10;- Gem overlay has been moved to the left side of the screen, to prevent overlapping with an open inventory.&#10;If you have a suggestion about default positions please let me know.&#10;- The export to pastebin functions have been automated by &quot;Linsane&quot;. Now clicking export will send an API requests&#10;to pastebin, and you can copy the link by Copy button. In case of daily limit (10posts per day) you can click Open&#10;to open the pastebin website where the raw data will be placed automatically.&#10;- - This can be usefull if you want to store the pastebins in the website and not post as guest.&#10;- Character name is no longer case sensitive.&#10;- You can now resize the window, and not get frustrated with 720p windows in 4k monitors. :)&#10;- When updating to new version you get a confirmation dialogue.&#10;- Data and gem JSON files are now downloaded separately and are updated automatically.&#10;- Skill gem icons are now downloaded on demand. (The first load will take a while to download all of them)&#10;- Changed the graphics for xp bar. It is no longer a bar, this allows you to place both xp, and gems overlays&#10; in the area between your potions and your skills.&#10;&#10; __Additions__&#10;- Updated the application to include Synthesis new skill gems.&#10;- Updated Skill gems to their renamed names. If you have a build that has a reference to an old gem name, it will&#10; automatically get updated to the renamed version.&#10;- Updated Skill gems to their reworked level requirement.&#10;" />
