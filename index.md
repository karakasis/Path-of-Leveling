*Some final words,*

    I am a pre graduate Student of Computer Science and this project is far from being professional or completed.
    As far as future update of this,I am planning to update the programm to keep up with the newest expansions.
    Im hoping to fix some major issues at February of 2019, when I will have some spare time.
    If anyone is interested in helping, improving or anything on this project let me know!
