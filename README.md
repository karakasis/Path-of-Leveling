## What does it do

This programm currently does three things!
-**Plan your leveling by selecting gems and links. ** You can create complicated transitions between your gem setup, swap a gem for another one, or completely remove a Skill group for a different one. Get a popup on your in-game overlay when you reach certain levels.
-**Navigate through the game's acts, with graphic representations from [Engineering Eternity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFHfrY-6uGSAvmczp_7a6Q/featured)** You can move the overlay around to suit your own needs. *Supporting only 1080p at this moment*
-**Track your XP and find out when you are under/overleveled**. You can move the overlay around to suit your own needs.

*Some final words,*
  
    I am a pre graduate Student of Computer Science and this project is far from being professional or completed.
    As far as future update of this,I am planning to update the programm to keep up with the newest expansions. 
    Im hoping to fix some major issues at February of 2019, when I will have some spare time.
    If anyone is interested in helping, improving or anything on this project let me know!
